Learning how to use GTK+ for creating GUIs.

# Building

Here's how to install the dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04:

```shell
sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev
```

Then you can build the demos via:

```shell
make
```

And run the demos via any of these commands:

```shell
./build/button_catcher
./build/img_puzzle
./build/video_trim
```
